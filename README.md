## Description
For this project, I created a professional portfolio using React.js. This portfolio displays information about me, my projects, and my professional career. Within this portfolio, users can expect to find an “about me” section that lays out my personal mission statement and a brief explanation about the career I want to pursue. In the Projects section, users can find 6 of my many projects that each have  a brief description of the application, a GitHub link, and a deployed application link. Users can also send me a message on the Contact page where name, email, and message inputs are available for users to utilize if they desire to reach out and connect. Lastly, my resume will be available on the final page for potential employers to view and download.
